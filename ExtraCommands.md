[SeLite Commands](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selite-commands/), one of SeLite [AddOns](AddOns), provides several Selenese commands and related functionality.

# Robust commands #
Commands with name in form `xxxRobust: typeRobust, clickRobust, selectRobust` action the same as original commands `xxx`, but if the target doesn't exist, then they skip and they don't fail.

# Random data #
Commands with name in form `xxxRandom: clickRandom, selectRandom, typeRandom, typeRandomEmail` generate controlled random data. The commands enter (or select or click) a random value(or an option or a radio button) for a given field (of a specified type). Optionally, they can also store the entered/selected/clicked text/choice in a given Selenese variable, so that the [script] can use it later (e.g. to store it in [script] DB).

Those commands perform two functions

  * main purpose: click/select a random element (matching the given selector), or type random text (more below)
  * optionally, capture the value of that clicked/selected element, or capture the typed text, into a stored variable. That facilitates later stages (e.g. when you submit the form and load a view of the record, then you want can validate that the clicked/selected/typed data got submitted).

For that the commands have two parameters:

  * `selectLocator` (or `radiosXPath` or `locator`), required: a selector to match the set of elements, from which it chooses a random one
  * `store` or `paramsOrStore` (optional):
    * `store` is a name of stored variable, where the command saves the clicked/selected/typed value. It may include field or sub(sub-...)-field e.g. `variableName.fieldName, variableName.fieldName.subfieldName...`
    * `paramsOrStore` can be either
      * a string: a name of stored variable, just like `store` above
      * an object with one or multiple fields. Following examples use [SelBlocksGlobal](SelBlocksGlobal) and its [EnhancedSelenese](EnhancedSelenese) to pass objects through =\`...\` notation.

`typeRandomEmail` co-operates with `typeRandom`. It types a random email address, based on a name already typed in another element.

For more details see [its Selenese tests](https://github.com/selite/selite/tree/master/commands/selenese-tests).

# Timestamp-related commands #
There are two sets of functionality that support [TimeStamps](TimeStamps). The first set defines commands (primary names): `sleepUntilTimestampDistinctDownToMilliseconds, sleepUntilTimestampDistinctDownToSeconds, sleepUntilTimestampDistinctDownToMinutes`. Each ensures that a timestamp from that moment will be unique, when compared to any timestamp created just before any previous or future call to the same command (or to a command with finer precision).

The second set defines functions `isTimestampDownToMilliseconds, isTimestampDownToSeconds, isTimestampDownToMinutes, isTimestampDownToPrecision`. You can't access those directly as commands in Selenium IDE. Instead, use commands like `verifyTimestampDownToSeconds` (see also {{navAutoGeneratedSeleneseCommands}}). Those serve to validate a displayed timestamp (identified by locator in `target` parameter) against a previously saved timestamp (passed in `value` parameter).

The second set also auto-generates commands like `waitForTimestampDownToSeconds`. However, do not use those commands because they could be misplaced with `sleeUntilTimestampDistinctDownToSeconds`. To prevent confusion, this subset of auto-generated commands (`waitForTimestampDownToSeconds` and similar) are handled specially: they fail. If you need to wait for a timestamp and to validate it, use a different `waitFor...` command (targeting the related element), and then verify or assert the timestamp (with e.g. `assertTimestampDownToSeconds`).

## Basic usage ##
  * trigger a change
  * `storeTimestampDownToSeconds` (or similar - for the chosen precision)
  * `sleepUntilTimestampDistinctDownToSeconds` (or similar)
  * load a view
  * `assertTimestampDownToSeconds` (or `verifyTimestampDownToSeconds`) against the stored timestamp

# Other commands #
  * `disableJavascript, enableJavascript`: disable/enable Javascript for the web application that is being automated
  * `indexBy` - index objects
  * `selectTopFrameAnd`
