# Maintaining the documentation
  * See [Github-flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), [Liquid for Designers](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) and [Kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).
  * Write and organise it clearly.
  * Provide examples.
  * Don't have any content before the first heading (`# Heading... #`).
  * Refer to third party documentation if you mention something for the first time (if you have a reference).
  * Try NetBeans. See [DevelopmentTools](DevelopmentTools) > [NetBeans as a Javascript IDE](DevelopmentTools#netbeans-as-a-javascript-ide). Install [Markdown support](https://github.com/madflow/flow-netbeans-markdown). Open the documentation folder as a PHP project.
  * Don't use fixed line length, especially not in documentation source.
    * A good IDE/editor should be capable of wrapping lines. Take benefit from all your available screen area and don't worry about line lengths.
    * Reasonably long lines make source search and narrowing down easier. Search results preview containing long enough lines may be enough for you to know that you can skip the occurrence, without opening that line in editor.
    * You need long lines for pre-formatted text, such as code blocks and [Drawn diagrams](#drawn-diagrams).
    * In NetBeans choose menu Tools > Options > Editor > Formatting > Line Wraps: After words.
    * If you need Eclipse, try <http://dev.cdhq.de/eclipse/word-wrap/> (install both components: word wrap and line numbering fix); however, line numbering fix (for Eclipse Kepler) doesnâ€™t work in Eclipse Luna (4.4).
 * Format any _chrome://_ URLs in _italic_ but don't make them links. See [AboutDocumentation](AboutDocumentation) > Firefox {{chromeUrl}}s.
 * Don't have blank lines in HTML comments in `.md` files. Such comments work well online, but not with [Markdown Viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer/) in Firefox.
 * Don't blindly rely on Markdown support for NetBeans, neither on Markdown Viewer for Firefox.
 * Preview by running [Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
 * `gem install link-checker` and `check-links _site` (not maintained since v. 0.7.2, Oct 2012; it reports broken external links but not broken local links). Don't use `html-proofer` gem and its `htmlproof` command (since it doesn't like GitHub-based relative links).
 * Use online [W3 Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink). A faster way: run it locally with Jekyll 3.0 (or with `gem install jekyll --pre`):<br/> `wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/S/SC/SCOP/W3C-LinkChecker-4.81.tar.gz`<br/> `sudo cpan -i Config::General Net::IP CSS::DOM`<br/> `tar xvzf W3C-LinkChecker-4.81.tar.gz; cd W3C-LinkChecker-4.81; perl Makefile.PL; make; sudo make install`<br/> `checklink --quiet --location http://localhost:4000/ http://localhost:4000/`

## Drawn diagrams
Don't use UML tools, as they are more restrictive and less efficient. <!-- That"s why I didn"t consider using e.g. http://plantuml.sourceforge.net and http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantumlnb -->

Draw diagrams in LibreOffice/OpenOffice and save them as `.odg`. Then Edit > Select All; File > Export (export the selection, rather than the whole drawing area). Export as a .png, not interlaced, with lowest compression. Then commit both .odg and .png to git. TODO: In documentation use URLs to the .png images from git ([selite/diagrams/](https://github.com/selite/selite/tree/master/diagrams) > navigate to `.png` file > get URL of 'Raw' button).

### Versions of LibreOffice
  * LibreOffice version that came with CentOS 6.4 didn't export as `.png` well - the quality was low.
  * CentOS 6.5 has LibreOffice 4.0.4.2, which is better than one from CentOS 6.4, but it still doesn't export very well.
  * LibreOffice 4.1.3.2 that came with Fedora 19 KDE worked well.
  * Fedora 20 KDE has LibreOffice 4.1.4.2, which renders well.

Please

  * follow <http://www.slideshare.net/otikik/how-to-make-awesome-diagrams-for-your-slides>
  * use colours black, Chart 11 for red, Green 4, Chart 12 for blue, Chart 3 for yellow

## Textual object diagrams
Object Diagrams draw ownership/reference relationships between objects, fields and functions. They usually don't necessarily describe class inheritance (which is clear from the source<!--TODO: and from Javadoc -->).

Text diagrams don't need to be esthetic, but clear and easy to edit - so you can quickly update them whenever you change the relevant code. They are in plain text, with **`<, >, ^, v`** for connections. The diagrams look like this:

~~~
Example                                     Description

ObjectConstructorName                       Full name of the class - i.e. the constructor function of the object.
Below the object constructor name are object fields. Indent them with two spaces.

.fieldName                                  Field with a fixed (known) name. Prefix it with a dot.

[ index description or expression ]         Dynamic field name.

[ ObjectConstructorName.SECRET_FIELD_NAME ] Field with a fixed name, not referred to via a string/numeric literal across the code,
but rather as a value of a defined constant.
~~~

## Headers IDs must be the same as their text
Don't use [Kramdown-specific header IDs](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#specifying-a-header-id), since they don't work in Markdown Viewer in Firefox..

## Generating raw links
GitHub doesn't serve raw versions of most file types with their MIME, except for images. So we use [htmlpreview.github.io](http://htmlpreview.github.io) for `.html` files. For any other files, e.g. `.xml, .xsl` or `.js`, use [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com).

In detail: Use _htmlpreview.github.io_ rather than _rawgit.com_ for `.html`, because if you pass a generic Github URL (rather than a commit hash or a tag), _htmlpreview.github.io_ fetches the latest commit of that file. So we don't have to update those _htmlpreview.github.io_ links. However, production _cdn.rawgit.com_ caches the files. So if you change e.g. `add-on's-name/src/chrome/content/reference.xml` or `extension-sequencer/src/chrome/content/selenese_reference_to_html.xsl`, then update its _cdn.rawgit.com_ URLs to use the new commit hash or tag.

### Updating links to cdn.rawgit.com
Navigate to [github.com/selite/selite](https://github.com/selite/selite) > 'latest commit XYZ...' link near middle top > 'Browse files' button near the right top > locate the file > 'Raw' button. The URL will start with _https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selite/selite/XYZ.../\<add-on's-name\>/src/chrome/..._ Then append the path part of that URL to _https://cdn.rawgit.com/_, i.e. _https://cdn.rawgit.com/selite/selite/XYZ.../\<add-on's-name\>/src/chrome/..._
