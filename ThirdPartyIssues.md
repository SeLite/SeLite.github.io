# Your vote is significant #
Below is a list of issues (or pull requests) in Selenium IDE, Firefox and third party software that complicate maintenance and progress of SeLite. They also restrict usability of Selenium IDE. Many of them were reported by other people, but they affect SeLite, too. Some of those defects and requests even have fixes proposed, but not accepted by the third party.

Only your vote will help to get attention of those third parties. Please, make the difference: Vote for these issues.

## Your privacy is essential ##
If you vote for an issue, by default you will receive automated emails on changes to that issue. However, you can deactivate those notifications. Indeed, voting for an issue doesn't add your email address to any forums.

# Where to vote

## Quick links
Use the following links to register with third parties, disable email notifications (unless you want them), list the issues/pull requests and vote for them:

<!--
Update the following links whenever you update the detailed list.
How to get the links for GitHub: I couldn"t make it search by pairs of [repository, issue #]. Therefore
https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Arefactoror%2FSelBlocks+label%3Aquestion+author%3Apeter-kehl&ref=searchresults&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93. To edit that search, visit this link and then follow "Advanced search" link from that screen.

Filter multiple GitHub pull requests by commit # and 'OR': https://github.com/Thiht/markdown-viewer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=213d5645af8+OR++f6269e7a3+

Please, vote even if an issue is closed (with comments like _doesn't meet a 'feature bar'_). Stay updated: subscribe to get updates about [new third party issues](http://www.feed43.com/8850141255642605.xml) (via RSS) and vote for them in future.

## Selenium, Markdown Viewer and SelBlocks (on GitHub)
[Registration with GitHub](https://github.com/join) is easy.

There is currently no voting for issues/pull requests on GitHub. Instead, add comments like '+1'. (Do not vote by Star button at the top right corner: It doesn't star the issue/pull request itself. Instead, it stars the whole repository.)

By default, you will get notifications for issues that you comment on. After you commented on an issue, you may want to unfollow it by 'Unsubscribe' button on the right. See also your [notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and [repositories that you are watching](https://github.com/watching).

## Mozilla and NetBeans
Mozilla and NetBeans also require you to register in order to vote. It takes a few steps, but it's important: those products have many more other issues and voters (when compared to Selenium), so we need many votes to expedite the issues. Register yourself at [NetBeans registration](https://netbeans.org/people/new) and [Mozilla registration](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi). Submit those forms, then check your email inbox and confirm your registration by following a link that you'll receive.

The actual voting is in two steps. Click at 'vote' right of Importance (for Mozilla) or right of Priority (for NetBeans). That takes you to a page with a checkbox next to Vote For This Bug. Activate the checkbox and submit by clicking at button Change My Votes near the bottom-left.

You can turn off any notifications at [Mozilla preferences](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email) or [NetBeans preferences](https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/userprefs.cgi?tab=email) > button Disable All Mail and then button Submit Changes at the bottom.
