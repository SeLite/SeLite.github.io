# Scope
We document only what is not self-explanatory. We describe the mainstream use cases, handled in the most common ways. For more information see [PackagedScripts](PackagedScripts) or the source code. Then you can experiment.

SeLite doesn't document general functionality of related technologies (see also [ReportingIssues](ReportingIssues) > [Support scope](ReportingIssues#support-scope)). If it elaborates on them, it's only if they are not clear or obvious from their original documentation source, or where SeLite modifies their features. Such notes and some references to third party documentation are at [SeleniumIDEtips](SeleniumIDEtips), [DevelopmentTools](DevelopmentTools), [JavascriptEssential](JavascriptEssential), [JavascriptComplex](JavascriptComplex) and [InstallFromSource](InstallFromSource). See also [Selenium IDE documentation](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.jsp).

Implementation is mostly documented by source comments. Detailed descriptions of Selenese [commands][command] are in reference files. You can find them

  * online - see [Components](Components)
  * in Selenium IDE reference pane (once you type a chosen command in IDE).

# Firefox chrome URLs for documentation and GUI
Selenium and SeLite GUI, some of their documentation and all their source, are accessible via special Firefox URLs that start with _chrome://_. (Those addresses don't work in other browsers).

Documentation presents such URLs as text _in italics_, but not as links. (That's because Firefox doesn't allow linking to them from the internet, neither from _file://_ based URLs.)
