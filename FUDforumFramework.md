The test example logs in as an admin and creates a user with random credentials. It logs in as that user and posts and validates random content.

# Install FUDforum 3 #
I had some sessions issues with FUDforum\_3.0.6RC2.zip. Therefore I've installed it from SVN, trunk [revision 5765](https://code.google.com/p/selite/source/detail?r=5765). See [Installation > Create your own install script](http://cvs.prohost.org/index.php/Installation#Create_your_own_install_script). In addition to that, you can try [Installation > Command line installation](http://cvs.prohost.org/index.php/Installation#Command_line_installation).

SeLite can't solve the captcha (it would be a weak captcha otherwise). Therefore select Administration > Global Settings Manager > Disable Captcha Test.

# Install SeLite #
Install recent [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org), [Selenium IDE](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/) and all SeLite [AddOns](AddOns).

# Install SeLite FUDforum framework #
Apply [InstallFramework](InstallFramework). The framework and tests are in [fudforum](https://code.google.com/p/selite/source/browse/fudforum) folder. Note that _appDB_ filename ends with _.db.php_ (e.g. _/var/www/fudforum-data/forum.db.php_).

# DB schema #
When extending DB table definitions in _fudforum/fudforum-framework.js_ see e.g. [http://localhost/fudforum](http://localhost/fudforum) > 'Administration' (near top right) > SQL (near top left) > inspect the schema.
