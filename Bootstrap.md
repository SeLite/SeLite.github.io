# Summary #
[SeLite Bootstrap](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/SeLite-Bootstrap/versions/), one of SeLite [Components](Components), allows smoother development of Selenium [Core extensions][Core extension] (just in plain Javascript files, not packaged as `.xpi`). It reloads them automatically on change.

It's more convenient than Selenium IDE's way of loading [Core extensions][core extension] (Selenium menu > _Options > Options > General > Activate developer tools_), which requires you to apply Selenium menu > _Options > Options > General > Reload_ button every time you change your extension file.

# Details #
It adds field `bootstrapCoreExtensions` to [Settings](Settings) module `extensions.selite-settings.common`, where you can choose file(s) containing your [Core extension] in Javascript (saved in UTF-8). Configure that through {{valuesManifest}} with {{navLiteralsForSpecialValues}} > `SELITE_THIS_MANIFEST_FOLDER`. That makes your [scripts][script] shareable.

If you modify any one file that is registered with Bootstrap (while using Selenium IDE), all the registered files get re-loaded automatically

  * before you run a single Selenese [command],
  * before you run a [case]/[suite] or
  * after you pause a currently case/suite run and before you subsequently resume it,
  * but not during an active case/suite run that started before you changed the file(s).

Apply [JavascriptEssential](JavascriptEssential), especially sections [Strict Javascript](JavascriptEssential#strict-javascript) and [Prevent name conflicts](JavascriptEssential#prevent-name-conflicts).

It works only in standalone Selenium IDE, but not in [auxiliary Selenium IDEs inside browser](SeleniumIDE#auxiliary-selenium-ides-inside-browser) (neither in Selenium IDE in browser sidebar).

# Limitations #

## Intercepts ##
Bootstrap reloads all registered extensions (whenever you modify any one of them). You can 'extend' existing Javascript functions as per {{navFunctionIntercepts}}. However, don't re-save and re-extend the current function each time the Javascript is run. Otherwise it would increase the intercept chain every time Bootstrap reloads it. Instead, save the original function on the first load only, but re-extend it on every load. For example:

```javascript
var originalMethod;
if( originalMethod===undefined ) {
    originalMethod= Selenium.prototype.methodName;
}
Selenium.prototype.methodName= function(pqr...) {
    originalMethod.call(this);
    // extra new tasks...
};
```
See also {{navFunctionIntercepts}}.

## Adding/modifying Selenese commands ##
If you introduce or modify any Selenese [commands][command] - i.e. <code>Selenium.prototype.do<em>Xyz</em>, Selenium.prototype.get<em>Xyz</em></code> or <code>Selenium.prototype.is<em>Xyz</em></code> - then those will be available to your [case]/[suite] only **after** you run any Selenese command first. <!-- TODO don't know why -->

## Switching between files ##
If you remove a filename from `bootstrapCoreExtensions` (or you switch to a different default [set] or a [suite] with a different [set] associated with it), Bootstrap can't 'unload' a file that it has loaded already. If you change that option later and you add the filename back, it won't re-run the file, unless its timestamp has changed.

## Dependencies between files ##
Bootstrap initiates extensions after any [Core extensions][core extension] loaded as Firefox add-ons (whether they use [ExtensionSequencer](ExtensionSequencer) or not).

If you have multiple files registered with Bootstrap through a {{valuesManifest}}, they get loaded in that order. However, if you register multiple files through profile-based configuration (as per [SettingsInterface](SettingsInterface)), their order is not guaranteed. Then you need more structure for that: package them as Firefox extensions and load them through [ExtensionSequencer](ExtensionSequencer).

On change, Bootstrap re-loads all registered files, not just the one(s) updated. That allows dependant files (that were registered with Bootstrap through a {{valuesManifest}}) to inject any hooks in the expected order.
