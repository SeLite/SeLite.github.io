# Support scope #
SeLite doesn't support functionality of related components and technologies (Selenium IDE, SelBlocks, SQLite, Firefox, Selenium selectors, XPath, Javascript...). See also [AboutDocumentation](AboutDocumentation) > [Documentation scope](AboutDocumentation#documentation-scope).

Search in current [issues](https://code.google.com/p/selite/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3ANew+OR+status%3AAccepted+OR+status%3AStarted+OR+status%3AWontFix). If an existing issue covers your problem, vote for it.

# Report an issue #
First, follow [TroubleShooting](TroubleShooting). Before you [report an issue](https://code.google.com/p/selite/issues/entry), note details and versions of
  * any SeLite extensions
  * Selenium IDE
  * any other Firefox extensions
  * Firefox (and if it's not a current release then also URL from where you downloaded it)
  * SQLite DB (if applicable)
  * OS and whether 32 or 64 bit
  * any non-SeLite components and their origin - the URL for download or GIT/SVN checkout (including branch and revision)

Collect any errors from logs (as per [TroubleShooting](TroubleShooting)). If logs are short, copy and paste them in the error report. Otherwise install [AddOnsThirdParty](AddOnsThirdParty) > File Logging, restart Firefox, re-run your script, save the log in a file and attach it to the error issue.

By submitting or commenting on a report, you agree that any part of it can be used in SeLite (under current or any future license).

## Submit any failing the tests ##
Save your test cases and test suites, along with any HTML forms/pages as per [PackagedTests](PackagedTests) > [Structure](PackagedTests#structure). If needed, include store any [SettingsOverview](SettingsOverview) as per [SettingsManifests](SettingsManifests) > ['Values' manifests](SettingsManifests#-values-manifests). Put that in a .zip file and attach it to the issue. That prevents typing mistakes and misunderstanding. Alternatively, if you report only a few simple Selenese command calls, you could send them as text
```

command | target | value
command | target | value
```
However, that allows for mistakes on both sides. Also, the system for tracking issues may modify text content (e.g. it auto-links URLs and #12 issue numbers).

Do not just attach screenshots that just show messages or your command(s). Also copy and paste those messages as text.

## Submit your Firefox profile ##
If the problem only happens with third party or custom extensions, or if it involves a complex situation, you may need to attach your Firefox profile. See also [TroubleShooting](TroubleShooting) > [Separate Firefox profile](TroubleShooting#separate-firefox-profile). [Locate the Firefox profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile) folder. Turn Firefox off, remove any [private data](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile#w_your-important-data-and-their-files) and _places.sqlite_.

However, GitHub doesn't allow issue attachments other than images. So, zip up the folder, upload it to somewhere on the internet and add a link to it to the issue. Alternatively, and only if the zip file is under 10MB, email it to the maintainer.
