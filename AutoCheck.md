# Automatic checks #
[AutoCheck](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selite-auto-check/versions/), one of SeLite [AddOns](AddOns), validates the current page after every successful Selenese command. (That is not necessarily on every page reload - e.g. it may skip pages that redirect.) You can use some standard checks (with optional configuration) or create custom ones.

## Negative checks ##
Negative checks validate that given selector(s) don't match any elements on the page. That's useful if your web server, framework or programming language report errors/warnings/notices in some kind of fixed format.

There is an standard negative validation for PHP.

### Ignored checks ###
Ignored checks are a special type of negative checks. Once you (or someone else) notice a bug via a negative check, you don't want it to be reported again (until it gets fixed). You can mark such bug as ignored.

Standard PHP detection class supports this (which works with [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) or without it). You fill in XPath logical condition(s) that match bugs to be ignored. Alternatively, you can create a custom detection class and provide the logic to filter out ignored bugs.

## Positive checks ##
Positive checks validate that the page contains elements that match given selector(s). However, it can't validate that HTML of a page conforms to HTML standard. That's because Firefox automatically fixes incorrect HTML and it adds missing necessary elements.

## Configuration ##
Configure these checks at [_chrome://_ URL](AboutDocumentation#firefox-chrome-urls-for-documentation-and-gui) _chrome://selite-settings/content/tree.xul?module=extensions.selite-settings.common_. In order to use [AutoCheck](AutoCheck) you must select at least autoCheckDetector or autoCheckDetectorCustom. Other fields are optional.
  * autoCheckAssert - whether an occurrence should trigger an assert failure; by default it triggers a validation failure rather than an assert failure
  * autoCheckDetector - choose a standard detection class to use; or set it to null/undefined if you use a custom class
  * autoCheckDetectorCustom - enter a name of the custom detection class (which you must load into Selenium Core scope e.g. via [BootstrapLoader](BootstrapLoader)); used only if autoCheckDetector is null/undefined
  * autoCheckIgnored - the format of entries depends on the detection class. [AutoCheck](AutoCheck) reports failures unless they match an autoCheckIgnored entry. Use autoCheckIgnored to match already reported bugs (so that they don't get reported again).
    * for PHP enter XPath logical conditions (not whole XPath expressions). Those would match either PHP warning/notice/error message (description) or a leaf file path (where the failure occurred). The conditions can refer to that text node by '.' (and they must not refer to parent/sibling nodes). Examples are
      * contains(., 'Undefined variable')
      * contains(., 'dbadmin.inc')
  * autoCheckRefused - enter locator(s) to be refused; none of the locator(s) must match any element, otherwise the page fails
  * autoCheckRequired - enter locator(s) to be required; each locator must match at least one element, otherwise the page fails

(Those fields are not defined in _chrome://selite-settings/content/common\_settings\_module.js_. Instead, they are added on the fly by _chrome://selite-auto-check/content/SeLiteExtensionSequencerManifest.js_).
